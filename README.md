# AppleMusicSearch

This project was bootstrapped with Typescript template of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### What is this repository for?

- Search for your favourite Artists, Albums and Songs...
- Validates if the form is submitted empty.
- `Bootstrap Cards`: Displays results matching Artists, Albums, and/or Songs related to the query.
- Only 9 Cards are displayed initially.
- `Infinite Scroll`: When the user scrolls down just before he reaches the bottom of the page, next 9 Cards are revealed.
- If there are no results for search query, the users are notified that `No results were found`.

- Used `Functional programming/Hooks` based approach over Class components.
- Used `Custom Hooks` for infinite scrolling.
- Used `useReducer` to avoid 2 useState calls.
- Used `Redux` to store state.
- Used `NodeJS + Express`to serve static pages.
- Used `Axios and Redux Thunk` for fetching data.
- Used `Moxios` for integration testing.
- Used `Jest and Enzyme` for test suite.
- Used `Text Constants` file to store all text contents.
- Version - 1.0

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in build mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
